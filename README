NAME
    Module::Install::Authority - Add an x_authority key to META.yml

SYNOPSIS
        use inc::Module::Install;
        name 'Example';
        all_from 'lib/Example.pm'
        authority 'BOBTFISH';
        WriteAll;

DESCRIPTION
    If you upload a distribution which contains an "x_authority" key in the
    META.yml then PAUSE will assign 'firstcome' permissions on any packages
    in that distribution to the user given by the "x_authority" key (and
    assign co-maint to the uploader).

    Traditionally, if you uploaded a dist containing A.pm, and then gave
    someone else comaint, and they uploaded a subsequent release including
    B.pm, then you had a problem as the initial author (you!) has no
    permissions to release B.pm

    Adding the "x_authority" key to your distribution fixes this, as it
    ensures that any subsequent packages uploaded as part of the dist by
    co-maintainers get their permissions set so that one person is the
    canonical source of permissions for the dist.

    This makes coordination (and maintainance sharing) much easier for large
    distributions, or those maintained by a pool of people.

METHODS
  authority ($pause_id)
    Adds an "x_authority" key to your META.yml or META.json

BUGS
    This module should be able to take x_authority from the $AUTHORITY
    variable in the 'main' module of the dist if present.
